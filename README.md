# Web-Based Video Management: The code provides a Flask-based interface for managing video streams and formats and several key components, that is planned to be adapted for AI-driven video and audio processing.

# Subprocess Management: Efficiently handles subprocesses and state management, allowing for scalable deployment of video processing tasks in a network environment.

# Logging and Debugging: The application includes detailed logging, useful for monitoring and optimizing algorithms and AI-based communication functions.

# AI Integration Potential: While the AI components like TensorFlow, are currently commented out, the structure supports the integration of AI models for tasks like video quality enhancement or adaptive streaming based on network conditions, depending on network performance monitoring tools.

# Scalability: The code is designed to manage multiple devices and streams, making it suitable for large-scale broadcast systems where AI can optimize bandwidth and resource allocation, especially for encoding and decoding.
