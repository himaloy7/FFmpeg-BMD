Web-Based Video Management: The code provides a Flask-based interface for managing video streams and formats, which could be adapted for AI-driven video processing via wireless transmission.
Subprocess Management: Efficiently handles subprocesses and state management, allowing for scalable deployment of video processing tasks in a network environment.
Logging and Debugging: The application includes detailed logging, useful for monitoring and optimizing algorithms and AI-based communication functions.
AI Integration Potential: While the AI components (TensorFlow) are currently commented out, the structure supports easy integration of AI models for tasks like video quality enhancement or adaptive streaming based on network conditions.
Scalability: The code is designed to manage multiple devices and streams, making it suitable for large-scale wireless transmission systems where AI can optimize bandwidth and resource allocation.
